# SLR-MLR
This project has used patient-data and cars-data to analyse them.
## 1. Simple Linear Regression or SLR

Patient data contains Waist circumference and Adipose Tissue count of the patients [Supervised learning]. 

We'll build a model using SLR [AT = b0 + b*Waist] 

So that, a new patient can use the model to measure the AT count instead of giving blood sample.

if the count is high, the patient is considered to have high-cholesterol. Hence higher possibility of 
Cardiovascular Disease.

X  - single input, Y - continuous

## 2. Multiple Linear Regression or MLR
Cars data will be used to develop a model with MLR 

[MPG = b0 + b1*X1 + b2*X2 + .....+ bk*Xk]

MPG stands for Miles per Gallon

X1...Xk  - multiple inputs, Y - continuous
