# SLR-MLR
This project has used patient-data and cars-data to analyse them.
# 1. Simple Linear Regression or SLR
\n Patient data contains Waist circumference and Adipose Tissue count of the patients [Supervised learning]. 
\n We'll build a model using SLR [AT = b0 + b*Waist] 
\n So that, a new patient can use the model to measure the AT count instead of giving blood sample.
\n if the count is high, the patient is considered to have high-cholesterol. Hence higher possibility of Cardiovascular Disease.
\n X  - single input, Y - continuous

# 2. Multiple Linear Regression or MLR
\n Cars data will be used to develop a model with MLR 
\n [MPG = b0 + b1*X1 + b2*X2 + .....+ bk*Xk]
\n MPG stands for Miles per Gallon
\n X1...Xk  - multiple inputs, Y - continuous
